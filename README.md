# SEC-Analytics
## A (in progress) System to download all 2-3 TB of historical SEC filings, run statistics on them, and then download the new daily filings to search for *

### You will need a list of proxys formatted to host:user:password:ip:port to be able to run TestGenerateEntries, but feel free to run downloadOldLoads.py, as well feel free to steal from me and redistribute oldLoads.csv so that maybe someone building a similar system doesnt have to manually construct the URL list.
